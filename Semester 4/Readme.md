# Semester 4

As part for the curricular projects we made four projects. 
  - [Analog and Digital Communication](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%203/Analog%20and%20Digital%20Communication) 
  - [Database Management System](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%203/Databse%20Management%20System)
  - [Economics](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%203/Economics)
  - [Embedded System Design](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%203/Embedded%20System%20Design)

# Analog and Digital Communication

  - We made M-ary transmiter and receiver using ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying) Modulation and Demodulation technique using LabView and USRP.

# Database Management System

  - College management system is a system which is helpful for students, staff as well as the college authorities. The main principle behind the need of college management system is easy to supervise and manage the institute. This system can help us to explore all the activities happening inside the college. It can handle the details of students, staff, teachers, class details, subject details, fee details, account details, curriculum details, etc. 

# Embedded System Design
  - In this exposed world with the increase in threat and security risks, the need of surveillance and control has also been increased. Which encouraged us to design a robot car which can be used wirelessly in any area having internet connection and can be controlled remotely. This kind of application can be adopted for surveillance at the border area. The same can be used for remotely observing house or office through the robot. WiRobot (Wireless Robot) is a robot which can be used remotely. The WiRobot gets instructions from the user through internet over Wi-Fi network and acts as per the instruction given by the user. Along with this, WiRobot is also gathering the information about the surroundings and will send them to the user through internet.
