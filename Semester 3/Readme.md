# Semester 3

As part for the curricular projects we made two projects. First project is in Data Structure and Algorithm. Second project was combination of two subjects Linear Algebra and Signal and Systems  
  - [Data Structure and Algorithm](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%203/Data%20Structure%20And%20Algorithm) 
  - [Linear Algerbra and Signal and Systems](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%203/Linear%20Algebra%20And%20Signal%20and%20Systems)

# Data Structure and Algorithm

  - We made an application based on Ahmedabad BRTS system which gives shortest path between two stations.

# Linear Algebra and Signal and Systems

  - As part of this subjects we made Head Counting System. This system takes an image of a classroom. Using the concept of Linear Algebra we compressed this image and then applied image processing concept to count heads of the student.
