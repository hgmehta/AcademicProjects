# Semester 6

As part for the curricular projects we made two projects. 
  - [Digital Signal Processing](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%206/Digital%20Signal%20Processing) 
  - [Software Engineering](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%206/Software%20Engineering)

# Digital Signal Processing

  - Despite the fact that biometric systems offer reliable techniques for personal identication, but because of the lack of a proper protection, it could be miss-used. When this data are transmitted through an insecure channel, there is a risk of being stolen or modiﬁed. Even several types of encryption to protect biometric ﬁnger data can be used as a potential mechanism but it is computationally very expensive and not secure on a large scale database, because somewhere at end user data template has to be decrypted before authentication. Hence for trustable and secure authentication, watermarking technology is essentially introduced to increase the security of ﬁngerprint minutiae transmission and can also be used to protect the original ﬁngerprint image.


# Software Engineering

  - We have designed a sales module of an electronic store using the concept of software development life cycle. We have designed ER diagram, Data flow Diagram, database and we have also designed the screens of this module.
