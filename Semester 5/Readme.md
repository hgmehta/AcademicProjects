# Semester 5

As part for the curricular projects we made two projects. 
  - [Computer Networks](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%205/Computer%20Networks) 
  - [Operating System](https://github.com/hgmehta/AcademicProjects/tree/master/Semester%205/Operating%20System)

# Computer Networks

  - Objective behind doing this project is to understand TCP/IP protocol. We simulated TCP/IP protocol. We implemented five layer of network.

# Operating System

  - **Objective :** The purpose behind doing this project is to understand the basic concept of operating system and to learn how operating system does a context switch. To understand the need of context switch and what operating system do while context switching. So we simulated a simple dispatcher which does context switch based on time slice.
  - **Input :** Multiple files are taken as an input. Each file is acting as a different individual process. Each process is made of a set of instructions. 
  - **Output :** We implemented round robin scheduling algorithm. So each process is given equal time to execute. Dispatcher will switch the process when time slice occurs.While switching, the variables of the currently running  process is stored in the file and the data of the next process is loaded to the main memory.
